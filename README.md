# Trust Stack Wallet 

The Trust Stack Wallet is a set of APIs, SDKs and tools to embed a Verifiable Credential wallet inside your existing application. It allows your end users to receive, store, and present their credentials through a variety of methods. 

We strive to offer a variety of implementation pathways from using a self-hosted API, using TrustStack cloud, headless react/react-native APIs, and a set of react/react-native component libraries for a compelling user experience.
